Hello! Iâ€™m Sidhant and this my blog. This blog is primarily a reflection of the kind of ideas and research work I involve myself with (mostly) outside of work. They can be from a range of ML topics that I dive deep into
  
  
In my current day job at [edge.ai](https://getedge.ai/), I work on enhancing talent acquisition and workforce management using machine learning. I work on concepts such as language modelling, entity linking, and knowledge graphs. 
  
  
Feel free to reach out to me by email for any questions or feedback on the blogs
